# SkyNation
Welcome to the SkyNation repository. This is a space exploration MMO type of game. I've been working on it for a few years. 
The recent technology allows the combination of SwiftUI, SceneKit, and SpriteKit to work together and make this game's production easier and faster.
The reason this repository is public for now is that I would like to find people like you. People that are browsing projects, and trying to find something cool to work on.
I intend to pull this project out of its **public** state to a **private repository** around February, 2021.
If you are a Blender artist, or can program in Swift any of the frameworks mentioned above, or Swift Vapor for this game's server, don't hesitate to contact me.
Feel free to take a look at the *ToDo* list, make suggestions, etc.

### Methodology 
**ToDo** Items are a part of a **Component** of the Game. Completing these items will ultimately generate one or more stars, that indicates the progress of that component. A Component will be fully complete when 5 stars are reached - in which case it means that no more work is required for that component.

### üìù Difficulty Levels
- 1. 1 hour or less
- 3. 1h < 1d
- 5. 1d < 3d
- 8. 3d < 7d
- 13. 7d, or more

### Star Rating

> ‚òÖ Completed components get a *filled* star.
> ‚òÜ Empty stars indicate that component is incomplete.
 
 # Completeness
 Each Item gets a grade 1-5 (stars) that rerpresents how complete the item is.
