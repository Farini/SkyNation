# SkyNation
Welcome to the SkyNation repository. This is a space exploration MMO type of game. I've been working on it for a few years. 
The recent technology allows the combination of SwiftUI, SceneKit, and SpriteKit to work together and make this game's production easier and faster.
The reason this repository is public for now is that I would like to find people like you. People that are browsing projects, and trying to find something cool to work on.
I intend to pull this project out of its **public** state to a **private repository** around February, 2021.
If you are a Blender artist, or can program in Swift any of the frameworks mentioned above, or Swift Vapor for this game's server, don't hesitate to contact me.
Feel free to take a look at the *ToDo* list, make suggestions, etc.

# üìù Projects
SkyNation is broken down into 5 projects.
The contributors to these projects shall have a **fair** share of the game, and therefore receive their share of the profits generated by the game and its related projects mentioned below.

## Methodology 
The completion of each **ToDo** item will lead to the earning of **Stars**, which represent a feature of the game.
Each **ToDo** item has a difficulty level. As each item is different, and requires some amount of work, a ToDo item should have its difficulty level indicated on the ToDo list, as described below:

> ‚òÖ Completed features get a *filled* star.
> ‚òÜ Features that need work done, are incomplete, or not yet started, get an empty star.


### üìù Difficulty Levels
