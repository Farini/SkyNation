#  Scene Assets
These are the 3D assets needed to complete the game.

## Mars
In Mars, the players will be able to build their own cities, and cooperate with each other to build `Outposts`

### Outposts

- [ ] Solar + Wind Power Plant: Generate energy for all cities
- [ ] Mining: Generate basic Ingredients
- [ ] Biosphere: Generate food
- [ ] LandingPad: Where Space Vehicles land
- [ ] Entertainment Center: Keep people happy

- Antenna
- Power-01, Power-02, Power-03, Power-04

### Mars Tech
Additional `Ingredients` and resources should be available on Mars. Some tech work should only be doable here.

1. Power Glass: A glass that blocks radiation from the sun. Needed to build Biosphere, Entertainment Center, and other outside buildings.
2. Heat pan: Mirrors pointing to a *pan* that stores energy from the temperature, like the Nevada desert poewer plant.
3. Mars Cement: Essential for building roads, and other structures
