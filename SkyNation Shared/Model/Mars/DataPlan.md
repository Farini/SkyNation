#  Database Plan

## Using CloudKit

1. The data is small enough to be saved in a public CloudKit database without using too much space (per player)

- Guild
- City
- Outpost

- Person
- Peripherals
- Recipes
- Ingredients
- Tanks
- Energy
- Air

### Costs
Basically, the public container is free to use up until a certain limit and then you get charged for anything extra. The limit is as follows:

As progress is made, the game must charge players to go past a point, which will be building in Mars.
